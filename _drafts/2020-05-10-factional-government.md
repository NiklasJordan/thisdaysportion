title: The strange case of the weak Johnson government
category: politics

We are rightly critical of the government’s communications during the pandemic, which reflect their general mismanagement and unpreparedness. However, I’ve seen some people interpret this as a machiavellian effort to direct blame for the results of this blundering – thousands of deaths – from the state to individuals:

> “Stay alert” is the pandemic's “Take back control”. Its meaninglessness is its very point. It permits each of us to act just as we desire. And allows Government later (i) to deny permitting that which turns out to be bad (ii) to assert it urged that which turns out to be good.

SAVE LIVES.’." caption="The UK government’s new slogan. The message appears to be that we can now return to “normal” life as long as we remain vigilant." %}

I suspect the effect will be to end lockdown in some shops and public spaces as the message broadly states _lockdown is over, just be careful_. The situation at work will be muddled, depending a lot on how employers approach coronavirus. However, all I think that’s going on here is comms by committee, the competing demands to _get Britain back to work_ versus a seemingly more sensible approach to control transmission. As with any muddled comms, the result is confusion.

This is odd as the Johnson government is in a very strong position, enjoying an 80 seat parliamentary, poll leads of 15-20% and a purged parliamentary party. The PM should be able to do as he wishes, whether that’s prolong the lockdown, pursue his original herd immunity strategy or claim we’re over the worst and can start lifting measures and get back to work.

Which begs the question, _why is he being so unclear?_

The first reason is the prominence of the lunatic fringe in the Conservative Party, which I suspect will ultimately never be satisfied or tamed. This wing dislikes lockdown for ideological reasons: It’s not government’s role to tell people what to do, you can’t trust “science”, the cost to the economy is too high, let nature take its course etc. etc. This motley crew of hard right, ultra-liberal, eugenicist oddbods now forms a large part of the government. Reason is no longer a part of the discourse.

This faction got to power by repeatedly rebelling against Theresa May. Tory moderates may have been more or less biddable, the likes of Ian Duncan Smith, Michael Gove, David Davies and Steve Baker less so. Perhaps they’ve developed a taste for never compromising.

Florian Schneider died some time last week. Schneider was one of the two founders of [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk), who I’ll assume you’ve heard of – he was the handsome one in a suit and proper shoes.

Here they’re an androgynous, cool, very smart, part Germanic, part Soviet quartet wearing expensive suits and make up. What does this mean?" %}

I found out while I was cooking tea in the kitchen. Fittingly enough, I switched the radio on and 6 Music was broadcasting the full-length version of <cite>Autobahn</cite>, the sort of dense, genius piece you only play for yourself once a decade as a treat, that you have to get yourself in the right frame of mind for. But this sort of thing happens in lockdown, and that was cool, until it occurred to me there could be another reason. But nothing on Twitter.

A quick Google and my fears were confirmed. I was sad, because Kraftwerk mean a lot to me, and I was slightly put out by the lack of social media noise. It was different when Bowie and even [Mark died](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-lead-singer-with-the-fall-dies-aged-60).

Kraftwerk originated from the same 70’s German scene as Can, Neu, (K)Cluster <i>et al</i> (Schneider’s first band was the magnificently named Pissoff). If you don’t know about what is more or less affectionately termed as <i>[Krautrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock)</i>, you should look into it. It’s wildly experimental, funky, electronic, weird music; far more interesting to my mind than the classical cannon of US/UK rock and roll. And I _love_ Krautrock for its extremeties and difference.

Around 1972 Kraftwerk begin to _look_ different from other German longhair bands. Schneider dons his suit. Musically, they also veer away from Can and Neu, focusing more on electronic music. It wouldn’t be right to say they were the only band doing this – Cluster’s 1974 <cite>Zuckerzeit</cite> consists of weird synth sounds and broken drum machine patterns – but they were the first band – anywhere – to use the sound of machines to create something purposefully _artificial_.

Freed from notions of organic, “real” music Kraftwerk could explore humour, romanticism, rhythm, complexity, simplicity, minimalism, modernism and history to create genius _art_. Like the most profound art, Kraftwerk contained many apparently contradictory ideas. For example, the electronic instrumentation looks back to the expressionism and modernism of pre-Nazi Germany, while anticipating the future of individual computing devices. Kraftwerk can literally soundtrack a [pocket calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSBybJGZoCU) or a Fritz Lang film:

Which is all wonderful, in and of itself. But what I love about Kraftwerk – and what they mean to me – is how this artifice results in beautiful, utopic music, free from all borders, ego, history, nationalism and constraints, but still capable of sadness. Often this was explicit in song titles such as <cite>Europe Endless</cite>, and in the subject matter of travel, the statelessness of being inbetween things, the joy of cycling. For me, this is what you find in Beethoven and Schubert, but in a language and tone more immediate and meaningful.

So, we can laugh at – and therefore overcome – the apparent uptight Germanism of, say, <cite>The Model</cite>, while losing ourselves in the romantic melancholy of <cite>Radioland</cite> (from their best album, Radio-activity):

May I suggest you come join me in listening to this on VE Day.

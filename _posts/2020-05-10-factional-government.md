We are rightly critical of the government’s communications during the pandemic, which reflect their general mismanagement and unpreparedness. However, I’ve seen some people interpret this as a machiavellian effort to direct blame for the results of this blundering – thousands of deaths – from the state on to individuals:

> “Stay alert” is the pandemic's “Take back control”. Its meaninglessness is its very point. It permits each of us to act just as we desire. And allows Government later (i) to deny permitting that which turns out to be bad (ii) to assert it urged that which turns out to be good.

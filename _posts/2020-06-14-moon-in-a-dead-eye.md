I discovered Pascal Garnier serendipitously, shovelling five or so books from a library shelf into a bag before a trip up to somewhere or other to flog our self-service system. I needed the barcodes to demonstrate the software in triumphant action.

It was the [Gallic edition cover](https://jacquiwine.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_1670.jpg) that stood out. After <cite>House of Government</cite> and <cite>Stalingrad</cite> I wanted something that I could gobble up in a couple of sittings, that wouldn’t involve complicated propping up and page turning systems. The Garnier book had stuck with me, and it looked short, thrillerish — and French. Perfect.

I’m glad to report this was a brilliant book, fitting for lockdown. A group of white, middle class retirees move to _Les Conviviales_, a gated community in the south of France. It’s horrible. The characters go insane in their own varyingly quiet ways, hurtling to an apocalyptic ending.

I _really_ liked the way Garnier used a seemingly loose, down-to-earth style, only to stab you with a pinpoint image, or surprise with some quiet lyricism. Similarly, at times you felt he _might_ be taking the perspective of a “sensible”, male character who never wanted to go to the community in the first place, only for this character to become the most insane of all, philosophising on a cosmic scale.

It’s a thoroughly bleak book with the hint of redemption in its climax. Cheered me up no end.

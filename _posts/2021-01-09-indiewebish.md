During 2020 I made a fairly sudden decision to come off Twitter. [Sitting here](/notes/2021-01-04-lockdown-chair) as a nearly-49 year old adult I have to pause before continuing. I was about to add “which was a big thing as I’d posted 20-odd thousand times to the service over 10 years.” This makes me consider what I would have considered adult behaviour as a 15 year old. I doubt it would have included posting brief missives about the outside world several times a day, and it certainly wouldn’t have involved me announcing the importance of these missives once I’d chosen to stop publishing them. I would have also considered “tweet” an infantile term. But here we are.

This decision came during lockdown. The constant post-something, check my phone for a response, check again in 15 minutes, do some work, have lunch, retweet something cycle only contributed to the claustrophobia of working from home in a small house filled to the brim with a family of two adults and two teenagers. I was (am) lucky to have a job that I could continue from home during lockdown – no wrangling with the DWP, no furlough, no redundancy; nonetheless, I was still stressed, suffering from an almost permanent low-level headache and fatigue, and a Matterhorn-proportioned workload.

Couple that with, y’know, reasons – Twitter’s contribution to the rise of Trump and the far-right, its ownership of all those little missives, tax evasion, its reliance on a huge content churning machine, and the time seemed right.

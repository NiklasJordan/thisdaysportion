This is the blog of [Leon Paternoster](https://www.leonpaternoster.com). The views expressed here are my own; they’re not representative of my employer unless explicitly stated. Disclaimers are difficult.

I write about lots of things – mainly designing and building things online, but also politics, books, music and other cultural _stuff_.

If you’d like to get in touch, email _mail@thisdaysportion.com_ Alternatively, you can follow me on Twitter: [@leonpaternoster](https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster/). Please note my account is locked. I’m also on LinkedIn, but the whole point of this website is to not be like I’m on LinkedIn.

_This day’s portion_?

Ambitious (tone – declamatory):

> Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day <br><cite>– Exodus 16:4</cite>

And personal, referential (also declamatory):

> Little boys are taking over<br>
They mumble through the grass<br>
They are not fit to be in the company<br>
Of vulperines and wolverines<br>
Too many heads knocking about<br>
Service<br>
This day’s portion<br>
This day’s portion<br>
This day’s portion<br>
This day’s portion<br>
<cite>– Service, The Fall</cite>
